## I'm [Orr Zohar](orrzohar@github.io) ðŸ‘‹

My research focuses on **Large Multi-Modal Models**, especially Large Image/Video + Langauge models, with the hope of pushing these models to be capable of evaluating the quality of actions in video.

Recent Work:
- ðŸ’« [Video-STAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06189): Introduced a method that allows the utilization of any labeled video dataset for instruction tuning. 
- ðŸ¤– [VideoAgent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10517): A novel agent-based system that utilizes a large language model to iteratively identify and compile crucial information from long-form videos

Currently, I am a PhD student at [MARVL](https://marvl.stanford.edu/), Stanford, and advised by [Prof. Serena Yeung-Levy](https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/).
